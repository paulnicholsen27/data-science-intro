# Introduction

- Goals
    - Explore some of the basics of Python
    - Solve a real-life problem with data science




- Data types in Python
    - Integer
        - show type
    - String
        - show a few string manipulations
            - .lower
            - .replace
            - string formatting
    - Arrays
        - A list
        - Have an order
        - Represented with square brackets
        - Iterable
        - Show index methods
    - Dictionary (hash)
        - Collection of key/value pairs
        - Demo how to set and get values
        - show .keys and .values
        - Iterate over one
        - Make one from an array of Spice Girls


- Problem:  How repetitive are pop songs?  What words are used with the highest frequency?

- Show lyrics page and introduce concept of pseudo-code.  
    - Plan:
        (come up with step 0 together once we look at the data and decide how to count it)
        0.  Sanitize data
        1.  Make a list of all the words
        2.  Set up a tally chart for each unique word
        3.  Go through the list of words and add one for each word
